## üìö Future Learning Goals

As part of my continuous growth, I'm currently focused on expanding my expertise in the following areas:

- **Cloud Technologies**: Deepening my understanding of cloud architectures, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and serverless computing to develop scalable and resilient applications.
- **Data Science**: Enhancing my knowledge of data analysis, data visualization, and working with big data tools (such as Hadoop and Spark) to extract insights and drive decisions.

I am constantly seeking new challenges and learning opportunities that will help me stay up-to-date with emerging technologies and apply them to create innovative solutions.
